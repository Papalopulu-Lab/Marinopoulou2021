# Marinopoulou2021
This repository contains Matlab code that was used in the paper "HES1 protein oscillations are necessary for neural stem cells to exit from quiescence" by Marinopoulou et al. 2021 to detect and analyse periodic expression in timeseries. The code is largely based on the Gaussian Process approach developed by Nick Phillips that is found at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GPosc and described in Phillips NE, Manning C, Papalopulu N, Rattray M (2017) "Identifying stochastic oscillations in single-cell live imaging time series using Gaussian processes" PLoS Comput Biol 13(5): e1005479. Please head over to the readme files inside each forlder for a short overview. It also uses routines developed by Nick which are integrated with the GPML toolbox by C Rasmussen and N Hannes (2010) "Gaussian processes for machine learning (GPML) toolbox" Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11:3011 3015. Please unarchive GPML.zip before running.
